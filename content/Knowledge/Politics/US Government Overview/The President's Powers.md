- **Executive Orders**: The President can issue orders to manage federal agencies and direct government operations. These do not require Congressional approval.
- **Appointments**: The President can appoint judges, ambassadors, and other officials, but Senate confirmation is necessary for judicial and high-level appointments.
- **Commander-in-Chief**: The President controls the military and directs defense policy but cannot declare war without Congressional approval.
