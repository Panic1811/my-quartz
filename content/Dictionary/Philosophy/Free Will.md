**Free Will:** The ability to have acted differently, the ability to act at one's own discretion.

*Everything you do is because you want to, or because you're forced to.* Uncertainty is solved by choosing the stronger desire or want. For competing desires, even if there is something you don't want to do, it will be driven by some other desire. "You can do whatever you want, but you can't want what you want" - Schopenhauer. , you cant control what you want. You can do whatever you will, but u cant will what you will.
