Moral Development and External Influences

- **Lawrence Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development**:  
    Kohlberg proposed that morality develops in stages, often beginning with externally influenced reasoning (e.g., obeying rules to avoid punishment or gain approval). Only in later stages do individuals engage in self-reflection and develop intrinsic moral principles.
    
    - Your observation suggests that most people remain in stages where external factors (e.g., laws, social norms) guide morality rather than intrinsic self-reflection.
- **Social Learning Theory**:  
    This psychological theory posits that people learn behaviors, including moral attitudes, through observation and imitation of others.
    
    - Example: Eating meat is normalized culturally, so individuals rarely question it unless exposed to counter-narratives (e.g., factory farming videos).

### 2. **Ethics of Happiness and Self-Fulfillment**

- **Pascal and Human Motivation**:  
    Blaise Pascal argued that humans ultimately seek happiness, even if their actions seem outwardly altruistic. This ties into your idea that people prioritize personal gain (e.g., pleasure from eating meat) over moral reflection.
    
- **Utilitarian Self-Interest**:
    
    - Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill explored how even altruistic-seeming behaviors might stem from self-interest if they contribute to personal happiness or societal approval.
    - Eating meat, as you suggest, may not involve moral questioning because it provides immediate pleasure, overriding ethical considerations.

### 3. **Moral Psychology and Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Morality**

- **Moral Foundations Theory**:  
    Jonathan Haidt's work suggests that morality is shaped by innate predispositions combined with cultural learning. Different cultures and individuals prioritize varying "moral foundations" (e.g., care, fairness, loyalty, authority, purity), which are then reinforced by societal norms.
    
    - For example, care ethics might conflict with loyalty to cultural traditions like meat consumption, leading people to rationalize behavior that aligns with personal or social gain.
- **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**:  
    SDT explores intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivations. Many moral actions may be extrinsically motivated (e.g., laws, social pressure) rather than intrinsically derived.

### 4. **Moral Blind Spots and Selective Application**

- **Moral Disengagement (Bandura)**:  
    People often rationalize immoral behavior to avoid cognitive dissonance. For example:
    
    - Eating meat without reflecting on its moral implications.
    - Ignoring distant suffering while acting morally in proximate scenarios (e.g., saving a drowning child).
- **Adam Smithâ€™s Sympathy and Proximity**:  
    In "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," Smith highlighted that humans are more emotionally invested in events closer to them. This explains why distant suffering (e.g., factory farms, global poverty) often feels abstract, making moral reflection less immediate.

### 5. **Ethical Egoism and Hedonism**

- **Ethical Egoism**:  
    This theory asserts that individuals act morally only when it aligns with self-interest. For many, eating meat or avoiding charity aligns with immediate self-benefit (pleasure, convenience).
    
- **Hedonism**:  
    Hedonism frames happiness and pleasure as the ultimate goals of human life. By this view, morality often takes a back seat to the pursuit of immediate gratification unless external factors intervene.

### Summary of Your Perspective

Your view resonates with these theories, suggesting that:

- **Morality is often externally influenced** (social norms, legislation, exposure).
- **Intrinsic moral reasoning** may be rare, with most people prioritizing personal happiness or convenience.
- **Selective moral application** arises from proximity bias and rationalization, explaining behaviors like eating meat or ignoring distant suffering.

This framework reflects a combination of **moral psychology, ethical egoism, and utilitarian thought**, showing how self-interest and external pressures dominate moral decision-making for many.
