### 1. **Chickens are Dinosaurs’ Closest Relatives**

- Chickens (and birds in general) are direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs like the T. rex. If you’ve ever seen a chicken peck at food, it’s like watching a mini raptor in action!

### 2. **Whales Walked on Land**

- The ancestors of modern whales and dolphins were land-dwelling, hoofed mammals. Ambulocetus, an early whale, looked like a mix between a crocodile and an otter, and it could walk and swim.

### 3. **Octopuses are Alien-Like for a Reason**

- Octopuses evolved independently from most animals, with a unique nervous system and three hearts. Their genetic makeup is so distinct, some scientists jokingly call them “aliens of the sea.”

### 4. **Sloths Used to Be as Big as Elephants**

- Giant ground sloths, like Megatherium, roamed the Americas and could grow up to 20 feet long. Imagine a sloth the size of a bus!

### 5. **Snakes Had Legs**

- Early snakes, like _Eupodophis_, had small, vestigial legs. Over millions of years, these limbs disappeared as snakes adapted to slithering.

### 6. **Giraffes’ Long Necks Started with Fights**

- Giraffes’ long necks didn’t just evolve for reaching tall trees; they also used them for “necking,” a form of combat where males swing their heads like sledgehammers.

### 7. **Crocodiles Haven’t Changed Much in 200 Million Years**

- Modern crocodiles are almost identical to their ancient ancestors. Their body design is so efficient that evolution hasn’t needed to tweak it much.

### 8. **Penguins Used to Be Giant**

- Ancient penguins like _Palaeeudyptes_ were nearly 5 feet tall! They waddled around New Zealand 60 million years ago.

### 9. **Koalas’ Brains Got Smaller**

- Koalas once had larger brains, but as they evolved to eat eucalyptus (a nutrient-poor diet), their brains shrank to conserve energy.

### 10. **Horses Used to Be the Size of Dogs**

- Early horses like _Eohippus_ were tiny, about the size of a fox. They lived in forests and had several toes for walking on soft ground.

### 11. **Sharks Are Older Than Trees**

- Sharks have been swimming in Earth’s oceans for over 400 million years, while the first trees appeared around 350 million years ago. Sharks have truly stood the test of time.

### 12. **Cows Have Four Stomachs Thanks to Evolution**

- The evolution of ruminant animals like cows allowed them to digest tough plants using a multi-chambered stomach. This adaptation lets them thrive on grass diets.

### 13. **Bats Are More Closely Related to Humans Than Birds**

- Despite their wings, bats are mammals and share a closer evolutionary link to humans than to birds.

### 14. **Cats are "Mini Lions"**

- Domestic cats share about 95.6% of their DNA with tigers. Their stalking, pouncing, and even the “chuffing” noises they make are all tiger-like behaviors.

### 15. **Elephants Have Lost Their Fur**

- Woolly mammoths, the ancestors of modern elephants, were covered in fur to survive icy climates. Elephants, living in warmer regions, ditched the fur to keep cool.

### 16. **Platypuses are Evolutionary Mash-Ups**

- Platypuses have features of mammals, birds, and reptiles. They lay eggs like reptiles, but they nurse their young with milk like mammals.

### 17. **Dogs Were Wolves Once**

- Every breed of dog, from chihuahuas to great Danes, descends from wolves. Humans domesticated wolves at least 20,000 years ago, leading to our fluffy companions today.

### 18. **Butterflies Used to Be Moths**

- Butterflies are essentially “day moths.” They evolved from nocturnal moths to take advantage of daytime feeding opportunities.

### 19. **Flamingos Are Pink Because of Their Diet**

- Flamingos’ ancestors likely weren’t pink. Their unique hue evolved because they eat algae and shrimp rich in carotenoids.

### 20. **Turtles Outlived the Dinosaurs**

- Turtles evolved over 200 million years ago and survived the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. Their secret? A hard shell and a slow-paced lifestyle.
