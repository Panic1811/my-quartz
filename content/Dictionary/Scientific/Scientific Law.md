A consistent rule describing what happens (e.g., "Gas laws describe how pressure, volume, and temperature interact").

- A scientific law describes a relationship or pattern in nature that is consistently observed under specific conditions. Laws usually have a mathematical basis.
- Example: Newton's Law of Gravitation describes how objects attract each other based on their masses and the distance between them.
- **Key Point**: Laws describe "what" happens, but not "why" it happens. They donâ€™t explain underlying mechanisms, which is the role of theories.
