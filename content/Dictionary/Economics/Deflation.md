### Deflation

is when prices for goods and services fall over time in an economy, which might sound good, but it can create a “death spiral” for the economy. Here’s why, step-by-step:

**Lower Prices, Less Spending:** When people see prices falling, they start to hold off on buying things, thinking prices will drop even more. So, instead of spending now, they wait.
    
**Companies Earn Less:** As spending decreases, businesses sell less. Lower sales mean less revenue, making it harder for companies to stay profitable.
    
**Cutting Jobs and Wages:** To cope with falling sales, companies cut costs. This often means reducing wages, hours, or even laying off employees.
    
**Less Money in People's Hands:** With lower wages and fewer jobs, people have even less money to spend. This further reduces demand for goods and services.
    
**Repeat the Cycle:** The cycle repeats—less spending, lower prices, less business revenue, more job cuts. This "deflationary spiral" can keep dragging the economy down, making recovery extremely difficult.
