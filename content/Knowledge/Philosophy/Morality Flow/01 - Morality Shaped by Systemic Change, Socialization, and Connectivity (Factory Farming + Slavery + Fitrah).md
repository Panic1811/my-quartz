Morality: Shaped by Systemic Change, Socialization, and Connectivity (Factory Farming + Slavery + Fitrah)

Started with me asking, why doesn't my morality align with my actions or moral obligation/duty? Brought up in regards to factory farms - and their inhuman nature.

--- 
**==What influences our sense of right and wrong—are they innate, or shaped by the society we live in?"==**

> **Morality** is the set of ideas or principles about what is **right and wrong** behavior. It guides how people treat others, make decisions, and act in ways that are fair, kind, or responsible.
> 
> Think of it as a **compass** for deciding what’s good or bad in our actions and choices—like whether to help someone in need or tell the truth.

1. **Morality is Shaped by External Factors**
    
 Moral values are primarily influenced by **systemic structures**, **socialization**, and **connectivity** rather than arising intrinsically:

 For most people, their moral framework is a product of **socialization**—the influence of culture, religion, education, laws, and community norms.
    - **Example:** Many people believe stealing is wrong, not because they arrived at this conclusion through deep reflection, but because it is universally condemned by society, taught as bad in schools, and punished by law.
      
Essentially, moral beliefs evolve as societies change. Laws and governance enforce moral standards that individuals internalize over time. Consider historical shifts:

 **Example 1: Slavery:** The abolition of slavery in the U.S. was driven by legislation, activism, and economic shifts rather than a sudden moral awakening in the populace.
**Example 2: Factory Farming:** This remains legal despite recognition of animal suffering, showing how systemic inertia can uphold morally questionable practices.
      
2. **Lack of Intrinsic Morality**
    
 While some argue that humans may have innate empathy (e.g., helping someone in distress), this does not always translate into consistent or universal moral principles.
    - Even intrinsic tendencies, like empathy or fairness, are **heavily influenced by environment**. For example:
        - A child raised in a culture where meat-eating is normal may feel no ethical dilemma about consuming animals, despite having the capacity to empathize with animal suffering.
        - Conversely, someone exposed to strong vegan advocacy might adopt a moral stance against factory farming, even if they previously saw it as harmless.
          

  3. **Deeper Dive Into External Factors & Moral Inconsistencies**
    
   Moral value often correlates with **how much we relate** to the affected being, forming an implicit "moral contract" based on emotional connection rather than objective principles. Inherently creating this moral hierarchy (rat vs pig?)

**Prioritizing Connection Over Principle:

   When faced with a dilemma, such as saving a loved one or a stranger, most would save the loved one due to the stronger emotional bond (+ genetic bond?). Similarly, pets like dogs are often valued over pigs because of their perceived closeness to humans, not due to any inherent moral superiority.
      
**Selective Empathy:**

   Humans tend to empathize more with beings who share traits with them, such as intelligence, communication, or emotional expressiveness. This selective empathy creates blind spots in moral reasoning:
    **Example: Slavery vs. Factory Farming**
         Slavery is condemned because it dehumanizes beings "like us," violating our sense of shared humanity. Yet factory farming, which inflicts suffering on animals like pigs—shown to possess high intelligence and emotional depth—remains broadly accepted, as animals are often excluded from our moral circle.
              
**Emotivism and the Role of Emotion:**
    
Emotivism posits that moral statements are expressions of emotions or attitudes rather than objective truths. For instance, saying "Stealing is wrong" reflects disapproval of stealing rather than stating a factual claim.. For example:
        - A child taught to see pigs as food may feel no moral conflict eating pork, but exposure to stories of animal suffering might evoke feelings of guilt, reshaping their moral stance.
        - Cultural norms around issues like capital punishment or abortion often divide communities, not because one side is objectively "right," but because each group has **different emotional reactions and values.**
          
In "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," Smith highlighted that humans are more emotionally invested in events closer to them. This explains why distant suffering (e.g., factory farms, global poverty) often feels abstract, making moral reflection less immediate.
          
 **Morality as Persuasion, Not Principle:**
    
Instead of uncovering universal truths, moral discourse often functions as a way to **influence others' emotions.** Advocacy against factory farming or child labor relies on triggering empathy by highlighting suffering in relatable terms—framing animals or distant children as beings with feelings "like ours."

4. **Hedonism vs. Moral Action**

Humans prioritize **pleasure and convenience** over moral obligations, leading to selective morality.
    - **Example:** People enjoy eating meat and are accustomed to it; this pleasure outweighs the moral implications for them, even if they acknowledge factory farming is cruel.
- This is not limited to individuals but applies collectively:
    - Societies only ban immoral practices like slavery or child labor when external factors (economic pressure, cultural change) make those practices less convenient or profitable.
      
Cognitive dissonance allows people to justify or ignore contradictions between their actions and beliefs, e.g.:

- “I care about the environment, but I still drive a gas-guzzling car because it’s practical. You want to be healthy, but you don't exercise regularly or eat a nutritious diet. You know that smoking (or drinking too much) is harmful to your health, but you do it anyway.”

> *Relevant Philosophy:*

> - ***Hedonism (Epicurus):** Humans often act based on what brings pleasure and avoids pain, even at the expense of moral consistency.*
> 
> *Relevant Philosophy*
>     
> *Cultural Relativism (Franz Boas): Morality depends on cultural norms, which explains why practices like slavery or meat-eating are seen differently across societies and time periods.*  
 
5. **Hypocrisy in Morality**
   
**Charity vs. Action Hypocrisy**:
    - Someone might condemn a bystander for not saving a drowning child but see no issue with not donating to charity, even if both actions involve saving lives.
    - This inconsistency may stem from proximity bias (valuing immediate situations over distant ones) or a failure to connect abstract decisions with tangible consequences.
      
**Slavery vs. Factory Farming:**
    - People often condemn slavery because it denies freedom and equality to sentient beings who think and feel like "us." Yet, many do not extend this logic to animals in factory farms, even when they acknowledge that animals also experience suffering. People might oppose unnecessary suffering yet justify eating meat from factory farms, demonstrating selective moral concern based on convenience or cultural norms even if the effort required might be trivial (Stop eating meat or picking something else on the menu - similar logic to a man having to leave his chair/standup would be a trivial factor when having to save a drowning child)
>     - ***Peter Singer’s "Animal Liberation" (Utilitarianism):** Singer argues that ignoring animal suffering is a form of "speciesism," a prejudice favoring humans over animals without justifiable moral grounds.*
        - **Thought Experiment:**
            - If we imagine a human stripped of traits we value (speech, walking upright, rational thought), but who still suffers, most would agree it is wrong to harm them.
            - Why then is it acceptable to harm pigs or cows who lack these same traits but experience suffering?
              
 6. **So, What Does Hypocrisy in Morality Mean?**

- **Revealing Moral Frameworks**: Hypocrisy highlights how individuals often rely on emotional or instinctual reasoning over consistent ethical principles.
- **Moral Flexibility vs. Absolutism**: This inconsistency may reflect a flexible, situational morality  rather than an absolute one. For instance, saving a child feels urgent and personal, while donating to charity or avoiding factory farming feels distant and optional (rationalized through cognitive dissonance - when your behavior contradicts your belief)
- **Social Conditioning**: Cultural norms heavily influence moral decisions. Eating meat, for instance, is normalized despite its ethical implications, whereas neglecting a drowning child is universally condemned.

Essentially, this shows morality is fluid and often dependent on **external forces, such as new knowledge, proximity, persuasive arguments, or systemic changes.

### **Systematic Change as a Solution**

1. **Why Systematic Change is Necessary**
    
Since individual moral reasoning is inconsistent and often overridden by the points mentioned above, **systematic change** becomes critical to align collective behavior with moral ideals:
    
- **Systematic Tools for Change**
    
    - **Legislation**: Laws banning slavery or animal cruelty create moral boundaries even when personal beliefs lag behind.
    - **Social Movements**: Campaigns shift cultural norms, like those against child labor or for environmental sustainability.
    - **Economic Incentives**: Making ethical choices cheaper or more convenient aligns moral actions with personal gain.
   **Example:**
        - Slavery was abolished not because most people morally objected to it, but because of legal enforcement and shifts in economic systems.
        
However, systemic changes enforce morality broadly but may contradict individual moral values or lead to **moral irony**: when a policy meant to enforce morality inadvertently upholds immorality.
        - **Example:** Prohibition of alcohol in the U.S. intended to improve public morality but led to organized crime and corruption.
        - Similarly, factory farming systems, legalized for economic efficiency, contradict growing moral concerns about animal cruelty.
          
2. **So How Do We Decide What is Moral?**
    
**Challenges:**
    - **Subjectivity of Morality:** Different cultures and systems have varying ideas of right and wrong.
    - **Power Dynamics:** Morality often reflects the interests of the powerful. For example, systemic inequality persisted under slavery because it benefited the ruling class.
        
 **Possible Solutions:**
	 - **Utilitarianism (John Stuart Mill):** Prioritize actions that maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering.
	- **Reflective Equilibrium (John Rawls):** Use reasoned debate to align individual moral intuitions with broader societal principles.
	- God as the source for morality?
	- ?
### **Fitrah and Contradictions in Moral Consistency**

1. **What is Fitrah?**
    
    - Fitrah, in Islam, is the innate human inclination toward recognizing good, truth, and submission to Allah. However, atheists might interpret fitrah as the natural empathy or moral compass evolved in humans.
      
2. **Contradictions Between Fitrah and Modern Practices:**
    
    - Humans have empathy toward animals but rationalize factory farming by creating distinctions between humans and animals. This is a contradiction in applying the fitrah of compassion consistently.
      
3. **Example: Factory Farming vs. Fitrah**
    
Islam teaches kindness toward animals, yet consuming factory-farmed meat often involves supporting a system that inflicts suffering (or killing animals during Eid).
        - **Argument 1: "Fitrah Does Not Apply to Animals"**
            - Counterpoint: If fitrah means recognizing suffering and acting justly, ignoring animal suffering contradicts this principle.
        - **Argument 2: "Animals Are Not Equal to Humans"**
            - Counterpoint: True, but that does not negate the obligation to minimize unnecessary suffering, especially when alternatives exist.
    - **Thought Experiment:**
        - Imagine if humans were treated like factory-farmed animals (e.g., confined in small cages, mutilated, gassed). The fitrah of empathy would condemn such treatment. Why then is this not extended to animals?
    
4. **When Fitrah Alone Fails**
    
    - While fitrah offers an innate sense of right and wrong, external influences (culture, economic systems, legal structures) can corrupt or override it.
        - **Example:**
            - Slavery was once normalized in societies where fitrah might have recognized it as unjust, but cultural and systemic acceptance allowed it to persist.

### **Final Reflection: Speciesism and Symmetry**

1. **Speciesism:** Many moral inconsistencies stem from valuing humans over animals based solely on [[Dictionary/General/Species\|Species]] membership.
    
    - Slavery was seen as immoral because the enslaved were humans, but animal suffering is dismissed due to species differences.
    - Symmetry challenges this by asking, “If animals share key traits like consciousness or suffering, why is their exploitation moral?”. Does it only apply once it can be demonstrated?
    - If a superior alien species were to invade us, are they morally justified to cause us suffering?
      
2. **Conclusion:**
    
    - Morality is not intrinsic but shaped by external forces like cultural norms, laws, religion, and education, etc
    - Hedonism and hypocrisy often prevent individuals from aligning their actions with their moral beliefs.
    - While challenging ourselves to reduce suffering, our focus should be on eliminating **unnecessary suffering**, as some suffering (e.g., challenges that foster growth or resilience) can have meaningful value.
    - Systematic change, through laws and cultural evolution, is essential for progress.
    - Fitrah offers a baseline but must be combined with critical reflection and societal progress to overcome cultural and systemic biases.
      
Are our morals actually being tested anymore?
