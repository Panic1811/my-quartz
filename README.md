# Notkesto (site)

This is the repository that I use to deploy a [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)-based site for my _**Notkesto**_, my personal collection of Markdown notes that I use to write down everything I learn and to document some of my projects.

You can find the site over at [notes.psycake.subspace.club](https://notes.psycake.subspace.club) and the repository where I store the Markdown notes themselves [over here](https://github.com/camargomau/notkesto).

Special thanks to [Jahus](https://jahus.net/) for the `notes.psycake.subspace.club` subdomain.
