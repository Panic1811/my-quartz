### Tautology

- A statement that is always true by definition, and therefore, does not provide any meaningful information.
- A phrase or expression that is redundant or repetitive, often considered unnecessary or pointless.

> [!example]
> Saying "all bachelors are unmarried" is an example of a *tautology*, as the statement is true by definition and does not add any new information. 
#### **Key Difference:**

- **Tautology**: Repeats similar ideas unnecessarily (redundant).
- **Oxymoron**: Combines opposite ideas for effect (contradictory).
#### **Synonyms**
- Similar: Redundancy, truism, platitude, self-evident truth, circular reasoning

#### **Etymology**
- The term "tautology" comes from the Greek words "tauto" (meaning "the same") and "logos" (meaning "word" or "reasoning"). It was first used in the 15th century to describe a statement that is essentially a repetition of the same idea.

#### **Denotations**
- In logic and philosophy, tautologies are often considered to be uninformative or uninteresting, as they do not provide any new insights or perspectives.
- In language and communication, tautologies can be seen as a form of rhetorical device, used to emphasize a point or create a sense of certainty.
