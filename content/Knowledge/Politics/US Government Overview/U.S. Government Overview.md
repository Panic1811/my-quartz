The U.S. government is a federal republic, with **three branches**: **Executive**, **Legislative**, and **Judicial**.

1. ==The **Executive** branch is headed by the President, who enforces laws and manages national affairs.== 
- The President is also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and has the power to issue executive orders and veto bills passed by Congress.
- The **Vice President** and the President's **Cabinet** (appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate) assist in carrying out executive functions.

3. ==The **Legislative** branch, composed of **Congress** (the Senate and the House of Representatives), makes laws.== 
- The primary responsibility of Congress is to **make laws** (i.e., passing bills), control government spending, and oversee the executive branch.
- Congress has the power to **create laws**, **impeach** federal officials, **approve budgets**, and **confirm appointments** to the federal judiciary and executive branch (for example, confirming Supreme Court justices).

5. ==The **Judicial** branch, led by the **Supreme Court**, interprets the laws and ensures they align with the Constitution.==
- The **Supreme Court** is the highest court in the land and has the final say on interpreting the Constitution, reviewing laws, and resolving disputes between states or individuals and the government.
- The **lower federal courts** (such as the **U.S. District Courts** and **U.S. Courts of Appeals**) hear cases involving federal law, disputes between states, and appeals of decisions from lower courts.
