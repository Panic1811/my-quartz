## School Management System

**Current:** Donams - *VidhyaDhan School Management System (VSMS)*
**Price**: 10K AED for 500 users (students)
**Issue:** Customer service is slow


Donams - meetings were good, modules (accounts, HR, payroll (not working, student trackers (transport, attendance & marksheet, grades)))

Problem: Modules there, CS saying staff not updating data, theyre blaming staff. They fix in their backend + then issues can reoccur. 

Limitation: Teach can only be assigned to 1 class - teacher permissions don't allow, HOD allows. There is no manually entry available for teachers.
