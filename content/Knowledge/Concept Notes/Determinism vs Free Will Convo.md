right: Mr. Determinism

< So, what is determinism anyway? It sounds complicated.

> It’s pretty simple, actually. Determinism is the idea that everything that happens is caused by something that came before it. Every decision, every action, even every thought—you can trace it back to something that caused it. It’s like a chain reaction where each link leads to the next. You feel like you’re making free choices, but those choices are shaped by things like your experiences, environment, and biology.

< Okay, but I can choose what I want, right? Like, I want a Tesla! That’s my decision, isn’t it?

> Sure, but let’s think about it. Why do you want a Tesla? Why not a BMW or a tractor?

< Well, because Teslas are cool. They’re electric, good for the environment, and they look awesome.

> Exactly. Your desire for a Tesla didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s influenced by your experiences—maybe you’ve seen ads, know people who own one, or value things like sustainability. All of those influences shaped your desire. It feels like a free choice, but isn’t it just the result of everything that’s shaped you so far?

< I guess. But what about something smaller, like deciding between chocolate and strawberry ice cream? I could pick either one. Isn’t that free will?

> Let’s break that down. When you’re deciding, you’re flip-flopping because different factors are pulling you in different directions. Maybe you like chocolate more, but you had it yesterday, so strawberry feels fresher. Your brain is weighing those factors—your mood, your memories, even the weather—and then you make a choice. The process feels free, but isn’t it really just your brain working through all those influences?

< Okay, but what if I flip a coin to decide and then ignore it because I feel disappointed? What about that?

> That’s actually a great example. When you feel disappointed after flipping the coin, it’s because deep down, you already had a preference. The coin just revealed it. Even that ‘gut feeling’ is shaped by your experiences, habits, and emotions. It’s not random, and it’s not truly free—it’s determined by what’s already inside you.

< What about situations where there’s no time to think? Like, if someone says ‘stand up,’ and I just instantly do it without thinking. Isn’t that free?

> Those instant actions feel automatic, but they’re still part of the system. Your brain is wired to respond to certain triggers—like hearing ‘stand up’ and immediately associating it with standing. That wiring comes from past experiences, habits, and how your brain processes information. It happens so fast that it feels independent, but it’s still part of a cause-and-effect chain.

< Fine, but what about my thoughts? Aren’t they mine? Isn’t that free will?

> Your thoughts are yours, but they don’t come out of nowhere. Why do you think about certain things and not others? Your thoughts are shaped by your environment, your experiences, and even your biology. For example, if you’re hungry, you’ll think about food. If you’ve just watched a movie, you’ll think about the characters. Even when you’re daydreaming, your thoughts are following patterns that were shaped by everything that’s happened to you. So even your thoughts are part of the chain.

< Okay, so you’re saying everything—my desires, my actions, even my thoughts—are just results of causes? It feels like I have no control.

> It’s not that you have no control—it’s that your control is shaped by everything that makes you who you are. Your preferences, your memories, your personality—they’re all part of you, but they’re also the result of causes that came before. It feels like freedom, but it’s really a river flowing downstream, following the path carved out by everything upstream.
