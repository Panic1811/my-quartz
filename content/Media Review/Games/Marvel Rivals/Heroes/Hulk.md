## Story
> [!info]- LORE  
> BRUCE BANNER
>
> Caught in the detonation of a powerful weapon of his own invention, Dr. Bruce Banner absorbed gamma radiation that transforms him into a massive green monster whenever his emotions rage out of control. As Banner, he's still a genius. But as the Hulk, he's the strongest one there is!
>
> Banner developed a special Gamma Belt to control his transformations and temper the Hulk's fury. But when the Timestream Entanglement transformed Los Diablos Missile Base into a demonic battleground, he realized that the best way to fight monsters was to let out the one within.
