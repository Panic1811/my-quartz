Denotation is the literal dictionary definition of a word, stripped of any emotions, implications, or associations it may carry.

**Example:**

- **“Snake”**: The denotation of _snake_ is simply “a legless, slithering reptile.” But the connotation of _snake_ could mean someone who is deceitful, as we often use it metaphorically.

> In linguistics and philosophy, the **Denotation** of a word or expression is its strictly literal meaning. For instance, the English word "warm" denotes the property of having high temperature. Denotation is contrasted with other aspects of meaning including connotation. For instance, the word "warm" may evoke calmness, coziness, or kindness (as in the warmth of someone's personality) but these associations are not part of the word's denotation. Similarly, an expression's denotation is separate from pragmatic inferences it may trigger. For instance, describing something as "warm" often implicates that it is not hot, but this is once again not part of the word's denotation.

> Denotation plays a major role in several fields. Within semantics and philosophy of language, denotation is studied as an important aspect of meaning. In mathematics and computer science, assignments of denotations are assigned to expressions are a crucial step in defining interpreted formal languages. The main task of formal semantics is to reverse engineer the computational system which assigns denotations to expressions of natural languages.
