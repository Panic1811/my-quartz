Argument From Change (Religion) / First Cause

**PARMENIDES - CHANGE IS IMPOSSIBLE** (Greek Philosopher - 515BC)

When things appear to change, it can be just that, an appearance, *an illusion*, nothing ever really changes at all. 

For change to occur, there needs to be something that a one point doesn't exist, and then comes into existence, for example
- A hot coffee will eventually change and become cold, however, the cold coffee is currently not there, it doesn't exist. If something doesn't exist, its nothing. For the coffee to become cold, it must come from nothing. 
  
  If something coming from nothing is impossible, then change must be impossible. 

**ARISTOTLE ARGUES THE CONTRARY** (Greek Philosopher - 384 BC)

Change doesn't involve something coming from nothing, but rather something coming from *potential,* which is not quite the same thing as nothing. 

Going back to hot coffee (Ed Fraser), the future coffee isn't currently present right now, but it is potentially present.  So that currently, the hot coffee, has the potential to become cold. The parked car, has potential to move forward. 

Couldn't this just be wordplay? The cold coffee still doesn't actually exist. Sure, but, consider something else that doesn't exist. Like a chicken. Sure, the coffee is currently not cold, but its also not a chicken. But this distinction is importantly different because the coffee has the *potential* to become cold, but it doesn't have the *potential* to become a chicken. While both the cold coffee and the chicken don't exist, the cold coffee doesn't exist in a different, more substantial way. While it's not present, it’s potentially present in a way the chicken is not.  "Change is the actualization of potential". **What Does It Mean?** 

- **Potential**: The possibility for something to become or do something.
    - Example: A seed has the potential to grow into a tree.
- **Actualization**: When that potential becomes real or actual.
    - Example: When the seed grows into a tree, its potential to grow has been actualized.

So, **actualization of potential** is the process of turning possibilities into reality. 

Imagine a match:

- **Potential**: The match can potentially produce fire.
- **Actualization**: Striking the match brings the fire into reality.

According to Aristotle, the match couldn’t light itself—something (your hand) must actualize its potential.

So, everything that changes has the potential to change, and something else must cause that change (an "actualizer"). -So If everything that moves (Motion, for Aristotle, didn’t just mean physical movement—it also referred to any change, like growth, decay, or transformation.) is caused by something else, you can keep asking:  

- "What caused that?" and "What caused that cause?". Example - Question of: What supports the turtle? Another turtle, and what support that turtle? another turtle...etc.  
- This leads to an **infinite regress**, which Aristotle thought was impossible—there can’t be an endless chain of causes because it wouldn’t explain why motion exists at all (*some atheists say, what about numbers going to infinity?*). This leads to his famous idea of the **"unmoved mover"**, the first cause of all change, which itself is purely actual (has no potential). 

 So, the '[[Dictionary/Philosophy/Unnmoved Mover\|Unnmoved Mover]]' can't have any potential (pure actuality), because if it had potential, something else could activate it into changing. So saying that there is one pure unchanging cause, that is purely actual, that is the thing they call god that actualizes all other changes. 

However, pure actuality, without any potential, is impossible, due to the potential of any actual thing to remain as it is. A yellow chair, can potentially be turned blue or actualized, however, it can also just remain yellow. A key property being it can remain as itself (or the potential to stay as is, at least 1 potential), otherwise it doesn't exist (and we go back to Parmenides logic). So god must have at least 1 potential, to remain as he is. The purely actual god, may then not actually be able to exist.
