## ⭐ Quick Ratings

1. **Story:** 5/10
	- Too similar to gladiator 1, but without the heroic trope - Russel’s crows character originally was a general, but in this movie he was 2nd in command yet revered? Close to no build up of authority, was just handed to him. 
	- Too many arcs & it was predictable. Long yet rushed, still felt rather unfinished. 
1. **Acting:** 6/10
	- Acting or actors rather were a little to immersion breaking, didn’t feel like I was liken at Rome-living characters. Keeping their accents didn’t help either. 
	- Might be a flaw in character writing itself over acting 
2. **Cinematography:** 6/10
	- At times felt like I knew it was a set, looked almost like theatre at times or a TV show production
	- Very similar shots to gladiator 1 but half the emotion behind it 
	- Over reliance on CGI results it in being almost superfluous and not grounded like in Gladiator 1 
3. **Music/Score:** 5/10
	- Forgettable, essentially blended into the background yet pales in comparison to Hanz
4. **Overall:** 6/10
> 	- Not good enough and not needed.
