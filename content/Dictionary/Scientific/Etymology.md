Etymology is about the origin and history of a word—where it came from and how its meaning has evolved over time.

**Example:**

- **“Salary”**: The word _salary_ comes from the Latin word _salarium_, which means “salt money.” In ancient Rome, soldiers were sometimes paid in salt, which was valuable for preservation. Over time, it came to mean money paid for work.
