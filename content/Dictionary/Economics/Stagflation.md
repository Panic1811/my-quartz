### Stagflation
- Stagflation is a complex economic phenomenon where an economy experiences stagnant economic growth, high inflation, and high unemployment simultaneously.
  - The term was first coined in 1965 by British politician Iain Macleod.
  - Stagflation challenges traditional economic theories, as most models suggest that inflation and unemployment are mutually exclusive.
