- **Facts, laws, and theories** all work together in science:
    - **Facts** provide the observations and data.
    - **Laws** summarize patterns in those facts.
    - **Theories** explain why those patterns exist.

#### Example: Gravity

- **Fact**: Objects fall to the ground.
- **Law**: Newton’s law of gravitation describes the mathematical relationship between mass and gravitational force.
- **Theory**: Einstein’s theory of general relativity explains why gravity happens (warping of space-time).

| **Fact**                                                         | **Law**                                                                               | **Theory**                                                                        |

| An observation or measurement that is consistent and verifiable. | A description of a consistent pattern or relationship in nature (often mathematical). | An explanation of why and how something happens, based on evidence and reasoning. |
| Example: "[[Dictionary/Scientific/Species\|Species]] change over time."                             | Example: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in genetics.                                      | Example: Theory of evolution by natural selection.                                |
| Does not change into a law or theory.                            | Does not change into a fact or theory.                                                | Does not change into a fact or law.                                               |
