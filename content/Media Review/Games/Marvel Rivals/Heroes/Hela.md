## Story
> [!info]- LORE  
> HELA
>
> The Asgardian Goddess of Death, Hela is a powerful sorceress who controls an endless army of undead warriors. She has long sought to expand her domain beyond the nether realms and will make any deal that benefits her goal. Hela will not rest until all souls—living and dead—are hers to command.
>
> Hela offered to support Loki's coup in exchange for an extension of Hel's territory into the realm of the living. In truth, though, she seeks to claim Yggsgard's throne—and the temporal power that comes with it—for herself.
