### Teacher & Admin Level - Attendance Issues (Reports) Rymy?
1. Opens App
2. Goes to Attendance
3. Is assigned classes by Admin, clicks students - present or absent - save and submit
   
**Issues**: 
- Teacher clicks save and submit, but report is not seen by HOD level. 
- It requires multiple save and submits from teacher, to show in HOD report view
- HOD can see which teachers did not submit for the time frame (Fix â†’ go to teacher and ask them to resubmit form, usually works after 2 tries)
  
  ==Donams said outdated software on phone, connection issue & to keep refreshing== 

  **Notes:**
  1. Need to find a way to backup all existing data in donams
  *Have not spoken to their support team regarding this issue*

### Shifts
1. Teacher can be assigned to only 1 Grade (ex kg2), when in reality, they are in charge of 2 grades (only 2 teachers are doing 2 grades) - example pre kg a, and pre k d are being handled by the same teacher but they're at different in the day. 
2. HOD every morning, gets manual lists from the teachers in the extra grades for students attendance (that have no teachers assigned, currently 2 people), but HOD does this 4x a day. From her view on donams, she picks grade, date, etc and manually fills and saves (not too much of an issue - other solution being create 2 teacher ID's - ==if we create 2 id's for the same teacher, payroll can get messed up, can cause duplication errors in others reports too==)
**==Can we add Attendance_Class_Wise to mobile app for Teachers**

### Student Progress Cards
1. HOD (HOD permission created by donams) does not have access to edit the mark-sheet, only teachers (teacher permission create by donams) do.  **No way to manually edit permissions** 
	**Teachers POV**:
	1. Twice in 1 term, students do assessment, and teacher manually grades it and uploads marks per students.
**Issues:**
1. When HOD is cross checking, if there are error's in the exam report view of the HOD, the HOD cannot manually edit this report, it requires the teacher to do so (work around being the HOD logs in as the teacher and does it) (==HOD needs Exam Offline>Mark Entry role permission (currently only for teachers))
2. From HOD POV, after requesting donams, she can edit the Attendance  (working days & no of days present per term) in the Student Progress. Ideally this should be automated, however, they were doing manual attendance between april to october, and then in october started donams. Another thing to note is that, we don't know if terms have been defined in the student progress card (as it isn't even showing data for the attendance that has been tracked by donams since october) (==Is there an import attendance csv option? If not, can they add it?)
- ==Terms defined in Exam Offline>Class Terms)
