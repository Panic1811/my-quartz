Aristotle called it the **"Unmoved Mover"** because he was trying to explain the ultimate cause of all motion (or change) in the universe without falling into an infinite regress of causes.

### **5. Why "Unmoved"?**

- The Unmoved Mover doesn’t undergo change or motion because it is **pure actuality**:
    - It has no potential to change—it is fully realized, complete, and perfect.
- It doesn’t need a cause because it is eternal and self-sufficient, existing outside the chain of causes.

### **6. Why "Mover"?**

- The Unmoved Mover "moves" other things not by physical action but as a **final cause**—it draws other things toward it by its perfection.
    - Example: Think of how a goal or ideal can "move" people to act without physically pushing them. Similarly, the Unmoved Mover causes motion and change as an ultimate source of attraction.

### **Aristotle’s Example: The Heavens**

- Aristotle believed the stars and planets moved in perfect circles because they were drawn toward the perfection of the Unmoved Mover.
- The Unmoved Mover inspired motion by being the ultimate source of purpose and order in the universe.

### **Implications**

- The Unmoved Mover is not a personal God like in many religious traditions but a philosophical concept of a perfect, unchanging, eternal cause of all motion and change.
- Later thinkers, such as Thomas Aquinas, adapted Aristotle’s idea of the Unmoved Mover to argue for the existence of the **Christian God**.
