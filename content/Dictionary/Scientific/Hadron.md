### Noun

A composite particle that comprises two or more quarks held together by the strong force and (consequently) can interact with other particles via said force; a meson or a baryon.

There are two types of hadrons: baryons and mesons. Baryons are made up of three quarks, while mesons are made up of one quark and one antiquark. Examples of baryons include **protons and neutrons**, which are the building blocks of atomic nuclei.
