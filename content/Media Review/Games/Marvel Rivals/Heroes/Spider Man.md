## Story
> [!info]- LORE  
> PETER PARKER  
>
> Bitten by a radioactive spider, young Peter Parker gained the ability to cling to almost any surface, a “spider-sense” that warns him of danger, and the proportional speed, strength, and agility of an arachnid. Now, he strives to use his great power responsibly as the wall-crawling wonder known as Spider-Man.  
>
> Since the Timestream Entanglement, Spider-Man has been swinging between two battlefronts. When he’s not rallying New York’s heroes to fight against ancient forces of darkness, he’s busy protecting the Web of Life and Destiny with his fellow Web-Warriors in Tokyo Webworld.
