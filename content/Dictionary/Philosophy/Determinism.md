#philosophy 

Determinism is the idea that all events, including human actions and decisions, are the result of prior causes and conditions, meaning everything happens because of something that came before it.\

*Determinism means that every event has a cause. For example, if you decide to eat pizza instead of a salad, that choice was shaped by your past experiences, your hunger, your preferences, and even the smells around you at the momentâ€”all of which influenced your decision.*
