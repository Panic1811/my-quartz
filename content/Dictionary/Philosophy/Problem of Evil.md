### Problem of Evil
- The problem of evil is a philosophical challenge to the existence of God, which questions how an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God can allow evil to exist in the world.
  - It argues that if God is all-powerful, He should be able to prevent evil; if He is all-knowing, He should be aware of evil; and if He is all-good, He should not want evil to exist.
  - This creates a paradox, as the existence of evil seems to contradict the idea of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God.

> [!Note]- Simple Version
> The problem of evil is like asking, "If God is so good and powerful, why is there so much bad stuff in the world?"

> [!example]
> *The problem of evil* is often cited as a reason for atheism, as it seems to challenge the idea of a benevolent God. For example, "If God is all-good, why does He allow natural disasters to occur, causing harm to innocent people?"
