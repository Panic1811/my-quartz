Carbon dating is a scientific method used to determine the age of once-living things by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon, remaining in their remains. It works because living organisms absorb carbon-14 from the atmosphere or food while alive, and it begins to decay at a known rate after death. By measuring the remaining carbon-14, scientists can estimate how long it has been since the organism died, effective for ages up to about 50,000 years.

**Key Notes**:

1. **How Carbon-14 Works**:
    
    - Carbon-14 is a rare, radioactive [[Dictionary/Scientific/Isotope\|Isotope]] of carbon present in the atmosphere.
    - Living organisms take in carbon-14 through breathing, eating, or photosynthesis, keeping the carbon-14 in their bodies in balance with the environment.
2. **When Organisms Die**:
    
    - The intake of carbon-14 stops.
    - Carbon-14 starts decaying into nitrogen-14 at a steady rate (half-life of ~5,730 years).
3. **Half-Life**:
    
    - After 5,730 years, half the original carbon-14 has decayed. This predictable decay allows scientists to date the sample.
4. **Sources of Carbon-14**:
    
    - Plants absorb it directly from the atmosphere.
    - Herbivores ingest it by eating plants.
    - Carnivores inherit it indirectly through the food chain.
5. **Applications**:
    
    - Used to date fossils, wood, bones, or other organic materials.
    - Effective for items up to ~50,000 years old; beyond that, thereâ€™s too little carbon-14 left to measure accurately.
6. **Limitations**:
    
    - Only works for once-living materials (not rocks or metals).
    - Requires assumptions about the original amount of carbon-14 and constant atmospheric levels, though these are generally well understood.
