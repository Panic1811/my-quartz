## Issues with Donams SMS:

### Attendance for Staff
1. Cant do attendance for staff manually. Right now, they have NFC staff checkin, but cant update donams manually?  
		- Dont have module yet, which allows nfc tagging for employees, hopefully this includes manual entry too. 
2. When searching for employee, in the search field, the search queries show employee's that are inactive. 

==Employee or Staff attendance can be tracked in Academic Activities → Daily Attendance Report. For manual entry of teachers (maybe staff as well), Teachers → Teacher's Attendance doesn't really show anything and ideally should be manually editable. Lets see how NFC works (end November implementation)
