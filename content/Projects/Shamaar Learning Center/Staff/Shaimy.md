## Issues with Donams SMS:

### Accounting Module
1. Have to manually enter data in tables (no upload for CSV available) - in Assign Fees - ==Asked Donams, they said they won't implement feature, has to be done manually==
2. No Bulk Import options
3. Playing catchup on data from term 1

==we need to test importing old fees template to see if it works. Fee Payments → Import old fees

**Temporary Solutions:**
Priority:
1. Day to day, use donams to fill in data for current days & onwards
2. Catchup on data from *September* onwards (term 2)
3. When priority 1 & 2 are done, fill in catchup data for term 1 in Donam.

**To Check:**
1. If data is now **not** filled in excel anymore, and **only** on donams - need to make sure they have an export feature to see all this data → for backup purposes, and if transitioning in future to new SMS - ==Fee Payments → Fee Reports → Collection Amount (we need it to show all values of breakdown in fees)


Universal report thing, where we pick certain 
**What I Might Need:**
1. The CSV - create a front facing table similar to their view
2. It should have the ability to search
3. Need screenshot of the table view in accounting module (assign fees)
4. Find automation to upload CSV data to fields in donams (will need login to this sms)
==may not need any more with Feed payments → Import old fees feature, need to test it
