Impeachment and Removal Process

- **Impeachment**: The **House of Representatives** can impeach a President or other officials by passing articles of impeachment with a **simple majority** vote.

      - **2021**: He was impeached again for inciting the January 6th Capitol riots, but the Senate acquitted him in both cases.
