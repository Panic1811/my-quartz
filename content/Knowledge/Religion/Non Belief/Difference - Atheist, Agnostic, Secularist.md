Being an atheist is not mutually exclusive with being agnostic. Just like being an agnostic or gnostic theist is possible. You can be agnostic or gnostic atheist. Just thought id clarify. Some examples here.

1. **Agnostic atheist:** I don't believe in a god. But i don't claim to know for sure.

2. **Gnostic Atheist:** There is no god and that is the pure and absolute truth. I'm sure of it.

3. **Agnostic Theist:** I believe in god but i don't particularly claim to know it for sure.

4. **Gnostic Theist:** There is a god and that is the pure and only truth. I'm sure of it.
