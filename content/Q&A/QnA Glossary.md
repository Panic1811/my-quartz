> [!scientific]- How do we know the composition of the Earth's depths if we've never drilled far down enough?
> Scientists use indirect methods to study the Earth's interior, including seismic waves from earthquakes, gravitational measurements, and laboratory experiments that simulate high-pressure conditions.
>
> > [!info]- Key Points
> > - Seismic waves travel at different speeds through various materials, allowing researchers to map the Earth's internal structure.
> > - Gravity measurements help determine the density of the Earth's interior.
>
> > [!example]- Practical Application
> > The discovery of the Earth's core was made possible by analyzing seismic waves generated by earthquakes.
>
> > [!abstract]- Fun Fact
> > The deepest drilling project, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, reached a depth of about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles), but scientists have been able to infer the composition of the Earth's interior to a depth of over 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) using indirect methods!
