### Evolution TimeLine Achievements

```timeline
[line-3, body-4]
+ 4.6 Billion Years Ago
+ Earth Forms
+ The Earth formed from a swirling disk of gas and dust around the young Sun. Initially, it was a molten ball of magma, later cooling to form a solid crust. Life? Not even a glimmer yet.

+ 3.8 Billion Years Ago
+ First Signs of Life
+ Simple single-celled organisms like prokaryotes appear, thriving in Earth's young oceans. These ancient microbes are Earth's first-ever residents.

+ 2.4 Billion Years Ago
+ The Great Oxidation Event
+ Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) start pumping oxygen into the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This changes everything—laying the groundwork for complex life!

+ 1.5 Billion Years Ago
+ First Eukaryotic Cells
+ Life takes a leap forward with the evolution of cells containing a nucleus. These are the ancestors of all plants, animals, and fungi.

+ 600 Million Years Ago
+ The Rise of Multicellular Life
+ Organisms start collaborating! Multicellular creatures like jellyfish-like Ediacaran fauna appear in Earth's oceans.

+ 500 Million Years Ago
+ Cambrian Explosion
+ Life goes wild with diversity! This period sees the rapid evolution of many new species, including the ancestors of most major animal groups alive today.

+ 375 Million Years Ago
+ Tiktaalik Crawls Onto Land
+ Meet Tiktaalik, a fish with limbs! It’s a key transitional species showing the shift from aquatic to terrestrial life.

+ 230 Million Years Ago
+ Dinosaurs Rule
+ The age of the dinosaurs begins! These prehistoric creatures dominate Earth for over 165 million years. Jurassic vibes, anyone?

+ 66 Million Years Ago
+ Extinction of Dinosaurs
+ A massive asteroid impact wipes out 75% of Earth's species, including most dinosaurs. Mammals take the opportunity to rise.

+ 6 Million Years Ago
+ Last Common Ancestor with Chimpanzees
+ The lineage that will eventually lead to humans splits from the one leading to chimps. We’re on our way!

+ 300,000 Years Ago
+ Homo sapiens Emerge
+ Anatomically modern humans appear in Africa. Early humans are hunter-gatherers, exploring and innovating in their environment.

+ 12,000 Years Ago
+ Agricultural Revolution
+ Humans domesticate plants and animals, leading to settled civilizations and the rise of cities.

+ Modern Day
+ Homo sapiens’ Reign
+ From stone tools to smartphones, humans are shaping the planet in ways no species ever has. The Anthropocene Era is in full swing!
