Observation that is verifiable with evidence

- In science, a fact is an observation about the natural world that is consistently confirmed through evidence.
- Example: "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level" is a fact because it is observable and measurable.
- **Key Point**: Facts are straightforward observations, not explanations.
