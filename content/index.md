**Welcome!**

This is the _**My Directory**_, my personal collection of notes. I use these notes to write down everything I learn and to document some of my projects.

## Site Overview

This site is organized into different categories. Each section serves a specific purpose, you can explore them below to see how everything connects and grows over time.

> [!abstract]- Dictionary
> My **personal dictionary** is an ever-expanding collection of words I want to remember. Each word is categorized and comes with its definition and context. An extra feature? These words are auto-linked across my site, so you can hover over them to see their meaning without leaving the page.

> [!example]- Learn
> This section is where I deep dive into topics that interest me. From short articles to my opinions on trending topics, it’s a space for thought exploration and sharing my current understanding.

> [!info]- Media Review
> Reviews and summaries of movies, series, games, and books I’ve consumed. Think of it as a personal directory to revisit what I’ve experienced—and maybe help you discover something new too!

> [!warning]- Projects
> A peek into my **ongoing projects**, which are often work-related and goal-driven. This section showcases what I’m currently building or solving, with updates on progress and outcomes.

> [!question]- Q&A
> The **Q&A section** is where I answer specific questions I’ve had on different topics. It’s a quick reference to jog my memory and also serves as a helpful resource for others. I aim to include common questions within each topic to make it more comprehensive.
