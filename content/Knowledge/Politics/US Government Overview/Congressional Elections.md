Congressional Elections

#### **Senate Elections**

The **U.S. Senate** is composed of **100 senators** (2 from each state) who serve **6-year terms**. Senate elections occur in a **staggered fashion**, with about one-third of the Senate up for re-election every two years.

- **Primary Elections**:
    
    - Like the **House of Representatives**, **Senate** candidates must first go through party primaries to secure their party's nomination for the general election.
    - These elections are **statewide**, and the winner is chosen by a **simple majority** vote (more than 50%).
- **General Elections**:
    
    - In **Senate elections**, voters choose 1 senator per state. Senators serve **6 years** and are elected **statewide**, not by districts.
      
      *In a top-two-primary like in California where there aren't party primaries, just whoever 2 get the most votes proceed, they still proceed with general elections for 2 senate seats (rare occurrence) even though both seats will be awarded to the 2 winners to determine who has more influence and power (whoever got more votes between the 2 in the general election). However, for other states, if there are 2 seats available, the races will be held separately to determine the 2 seats (so its not just based on 1 race cycle) 
      
**The Senate**:

- The **Senate** has the **power to confirm** appointments to the federal judiciary, including the **Supreme Court**, as well as **cabinet positions** (with a **simple majority**).
- The **Senate** can also approve **treaties** with a **two-thirds majority**.
- For **impeachment trials**, the **Senate** needs a **two-thirds majority** to convict and remove a federal official from office.

#### **House of Representatives Elections**

The **House of Representatives** is made up of **435 members**, each serving **2-year terms**. They represent congressional districts based on **population**, with the number of representatives from each state determined by the **census** (which occurs every 10 years).

- **District-Based Elections:**
    
    - The **U.S. House of Representatives** consists of **435 seats**, and each seat corresponds to a specific **district** in a state.
    - These districts are drawn based on **population** and are recalibrated every **10 years** through **redistricting** (following the census) to ensure equal representation across the country.
    - Each district holds a **primary election** where the **Democratic** and **Republican** candidates (or candidates from other parties) compete to win their party’s nomination.
    
- **Primary Elections:**
    
    - In each district, the **Democratic (DNC)** and **Republican (RNC)** primaries will determine the **party's candidate** for that district.
    - These are typically **closed primaries**, meaning only registered party members can vote. But some states may have **open primaries** where voters do not have to be registered with a specific party to vote in that party’s primary.
    
- **General Election:**
    
    - After the primaries, the **winners** from the **DNC** and **RNC** (and other parties, if applicable) run in the **general election** for that specific district seat.
    - The **general election** is a **first-past-the-post** system, meaning whoever gets the most votes in the district wins the seat (no need for a majority, just a plurality).
      
      *Again the top-two-primary system like in California works just based on the top 2 picks per primary regardless of party, and then general election to determine the winner (both 2 finalists in general election could be from the same party*

- **The House of Representatives**:
    
    - The **House** is responsible for initiating **revenue bills** (taxes), but the **Senate** can amend these bills.
    - The **House** has the power to **impeach** federal officials, but the **Senate** conducts the impeachment trial.
    - Laws and bills require a **simple majority** (more than 50%) in the **House** to pass.
    - **While both senate and house can pass laws, the house usually initiates them as the senate looks at bigger long term goals - both need each others vote though**

#### **Governor Elections**

**Governors** are elected to run individual states, with the length of their term set by each state’s laws (typically **4 years**).

- **Primary Elections**:
    
    - Like the Senate and House, governors must go through **primary elections** to secure their party's nomination.
    - They run statewide, and voters in their state will cast ballots to decide who the **party nominee** will be.
- **General Elections**:
    
    - Governor elections are **statewide** and occur every 4 years in most states. The winner is decided by a **simple majority**.
