## Issues With Donams SMS

### Student List
1. Student list, admins can add users with tons of fields. However, for the export or table view, we can't add columns. Limited export features, cant export with all fields? at least in admin view.  Need to discuss with them or check super admin.  - ==Student list can be custom exported with all fields, under "student information" on admin view. Student list can be uploaded as CSV too. 

### Reminders
1. Additionally, be able to set alerts or reminders when fields we set are not meeting criteria (ex, emirates ID expiring in 1 month, we should get a reminder) - ==possible solution is to regularly download student information, and use excel to filter emirates Id's expiring in x days - but if they can include notification, as seen its a setting for other modules, would be better)==

### How Tina Uses it:
1. **New Student Admission:** 
	- Parents fills out physical admissions form, and shares all hard copies of documents. Essentially all fields that donams mandates are essential (==actually admin can decide mandated fields too)== , those documents and fields are requested from the parent. (==We need to inquire regarding new student creation, some criteria check to see if they exist already - Parents have a toggle "existing parent", perhaps for students too, if it doesn't break anything?)

### **Waiting Period - Cooldown Period:**
1. Pricing structure need to find out for Donams. Is it 500+ active users? Or Active + Inactive? Is it per user? When is it charged? ==According to Shyni, its 500 active students==
