> [!info]- LORE  
> Adam Warlock was created to be the perfect specimen. Able to manipulate powerful cosmic forces, he represents the full potential of what we could one day become. Until then, he stands alone as a shining golden beacon of all that is good within us.  
>  
> When the Timestream Entanglement struck, Adam Warlock reflexively shielded himself in a protective cocoon. When he emerged, his cosmic senses identified Knull's impending threat. Traveling to Klyntar, Adam encountered the Guardians of the Galaxy and discovered a power even greater than Knull's, ready to incinerate the planet—and countless others.
